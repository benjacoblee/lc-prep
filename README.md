**Algorithms**

-   [ ] Bit Manipulation & Numbers — difference btw Unsigned vs signed numbers
-   [ ] Stability in Sorting
-   [x] Mergesort
-   [x] Quicksort
-   [x] Heapsort — Sort it in-place to get O(1) space
-   [x] Binary Search
-   [ ] Selections — Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Median of Medians) — Implement all three ways
-   [ ] Permutations
-   [ ] Subsets
-   [x] BFS Graph
-   [x] DFS Graph
-   [x] Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to implement)
-   [x] Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
-   [ ] External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
-   [ ] NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
-   [ ] Topological Sort
-   [ ] Detect cycle in an undirected graph
-   [ ] Detect a cycle in a directed graph
-   [ ] Count connected components in a graph
-   [ ] Find strongly connected components in a graph

**Implementation**

-   [ ] Reverse a linked list
-   [ ] Implement a Stack & a Queue using Array
-   [ ] Implement a HashTable with simple Hashing functions
-   [ ] Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS.
-   [ ] Write the binary search algorithm both recursively and iteratively
-   [ ] Write the merge sort algorithm
-   [ ] Write the quicksort algorithm
-   [ ] Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order — all three of them) and BFS.
-   [ ] Implement a trie.
