# Stability in Sorting

A sorting algorithm is said to be stable when two objects with the same key are in the same relative order before and after the sort.

## When is stability important?
- When data requires retention of initial order

## When is stability unimportant?

- When equal elements are indistinguishable (integers)
- When there are no duplicate keys

## Stable sorting algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Count sort

## Unstable sorting algorithms
- Quick sort
- Heap sort

Any sorting algorithm that is not stable can be modified to be stable by changing the key comparison operation.
