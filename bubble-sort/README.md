# Bubble Sort

A sorting algorithm where larger values bubble to the top. The average and worst-case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n2)

## Pseudocode

-   Start looping from the end of the array towards the beginning with a variable called i
-   Start an inner loop with a variable called j from the beginning while j is less than i - 1
-   If arr[j] is greated than arr[j+1], swap the values
